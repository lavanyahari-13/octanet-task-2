This project is a simple yet functional Todo List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the application is to allow users to create, manage, and store a list of tasks they wish to complete.
The HTML structure defines the main layout of the app. It includes an input field for entering tasks, a button to add new tasks, and a container to display the list of todos. The design is styled with CSS to enhance user experience. A visually appealing background, rounded input fields, and a centered card-like container make the interface clean and modern. Hover effects and color choices improve interactivity and readability.
JavaScript is the core of the app’s functionality. When a user enters a task and clicks the “Add” button, the task is appended to the list and stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persistence even after a page refresh. Tasks are displayed dynamically as paragraph elements. Users can click a task to strike it through, indicating completion, and double-click to remove it completely. These interactions also update the localStorage accordingly, keeping the data in sync with the visual state.
Upon loading the page, the app checks localStorage for any previously saved todos and re-renders them, making the experience seamless across sessions.
This project demonstrates essential web development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage usage. It's ideal for beginners learning front-end development, offering practical experience with core technologies. Additional features like categorizing tasks, setting deadlines, or adding priority levels can be included to further enhance the app.
